CodeQuest: Interactive Coding Education Platform
CodeQuest is an innovative, interactive platform designed to teach coding in a hands-on, engaging way. Itâ€™s built for both beginners and those looking to strengthen their coding skills. With its user-friendly interface, CodeQuest allows users to write, execute, and test code directly in their browser, providing immediate feedback on their solutions. The platform integrates with the JDoodle API for real-time code execution, making learning coding more interactive and accessible.

Key Features:
Real-Time Code Execution: Integrated with the JDoodle API, users can write code in various programming languages, including Python, C++, Java, and more, and execute it instantly to see results and debug errors in real-time.

Interactive Tutorials: The platform offers structured, step-by-step lessons that walk users through coding concepts. Tutorials include challenges that become progressively more difficult, ensuring that learners can gradually build up their skills.

Instant Feedback: After each coding exercise, users receive immediate feedback on their code. This helps them identify and fix mistakes quickly, which is essential for learning and improving problem-solving skills.

Multi-Language Support: CodeQuest supports several programming languages, starting with Python, C++, and Java. This flexibility allows users to experiment with different languages and expand their coding knowledge.

Project-Based Learning: In addition to lessons, CodeQuest includes mini-projects where users can apply their skills to solve real-world problems, reinforcing concepts through practical use cases.

Leaderboard and Challenges: A built-in leaderboard motivates users to complete challenges and compete with others, encouraging a fun and competitive learning environment.

User Profiles and Progress Tracking: Each user can create a profile to track their progress, view completed tutorials, and revisit previous lessons to reinforce learning.

Project Goals:
Make Coding Accessible: CodeQuest aims to democratize coding education by providing a free, interactive platform for learners of all ages and skill levels.
Engage Learners with Practical Exercises: By combining theory with hands-on practice, CodeQuest ensures that learners can apply their knowledge in real coding scenarios.
Foster Community Learning: The platform encourages interaction and collaboration among users, allowing them to share solutions, tips, and resources.
